## 3. File and Folder Management Automator
##

This is a Powershell script to practise and make a toolset of more advanced usage of Powershell such as: 
  - Find the total file count of all files in the archived location before the move
  - Archive all user files in all home folders
  - Find the total file count of all files in the archived location after the move
  - Ensure the local system's admnistrators group has full control over all files in the archive folder path
